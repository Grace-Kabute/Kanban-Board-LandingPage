                    <span>About</span>
                    TaskFlow was born out of a genuine need for better project management tools in my daily life as a software engineer. While working on various projects, I often found myself juggling multiple tools for collaboration, task management, and communication. This inefficiency sparked the idea for TaskFlowâ€”a unified platform that simplifies project management by integrating essential features in one place.
